## Prerequisites
----------------

1. Create conda environment:

        conda create -n cbp python=3
        conda activate cbp

2. Install required packages:

        conda config --add channels conda-forge
        conda config --set channel_priority strict
        conda install matplotlib mdanalysis plip pdbfixer requests gromacs
        pip install pdb-tools art suds
    
    Note: in case you want to install jupyter, it is suggested to do it before the pip installation lines
    
3. Clone the `CBP` repository from GitHub

        git clone https://github.com/lorenzopallante/CBP

4. Install required additional softwares: 
   
   - GROMACS
    -> easy way: `sudo apt install gromacs` (Recommended way for the present application)
    -> hard way: compile it from source: https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/install-guide/index.html
   
   - PLANTS and SPORES
    -> executable present in this repo 
    -> if you need them, download from http://www.tcd.uni-konstanz.de/

    - R (you should encounter some permission errors.. add permission to the R installation folders)
    `sudo apt-get update`
    `sudo apt-get install r-base`
    install additional packages from the R console (type 'R' in the terminal)
    `install.packages("ggplot2")` 
    `install.packages("gplots")` 
    `install.packages("dplyr")` 
    `install.packages("stringr")`
    `install.packages("GOxploreR")`
    `install.packages("igraph")`

    install topGO and relative additional packages using the following coding line: 
    `if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))`
    `   install.packages("BiocManager")`
    `BiocManager::install(version = "3.17")`
    `BiocManager::install("topGO")`  
    `BiocManager::install("biomatRt")`
    `BiocManager::install("org.Hs.eg.db")`
    `BiocManager::install("Rgraphviz")`


    You may need to install these libs on your Lunux machine to be able to install BiocManager and related packages: 
    curl: `sudo apt-get install curl`
    libssl-dev: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
    libcurl: `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev`
    xml2: `sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev`

5. Download the database folder collecting the PDB to be screened (approx. 80 GB)


Enjoy!

## How to use VirtuousPocketome
-------------------------------

The main code to run VirtuousPocketome is `master.py` within the code folder. 

To learn how to run, just type: 

    python master.py --help

The best way to run the code is to use a configuration file (example available in the data folder)

    python master.py --config config_template.txt

You need to provide at least the path to the protein-ligand complex pdb file and the chain labels identifying the two elements in the system. 

Briefly, the master.py code will call in order: 

1- `generate_assam_motifs.py` to generate the ASSAM motifs from the input file(s)
    
2 - `run_assam.py` to perform the Similarity Search using ASSAM

3 - `analyse_assam.py` to perform the multi-step filtering process 

The function library for the codes is `motif_search.py`.
